# AeroPonto

- Embedded system developed to obtain the attendance record of team members in the laboratory.

## Operation

- For the construction, an Arduino Uno, an RFID Mfrc522 Kit Module, an RTC module, an SD card module, and a 16x2 LCD display were used.
- Using the cards included in the kit, the member would pass them on the RFID sensor, and the name, time, and date of the reading would be saved on the SD card, as well as displayed on the LCD.

## Usage

- After building the circuit, use the "TagsIdentifier" code to obtain the tags of the cards that will be used and associate them with each person's name.
- Then simply compile the aeroponto.ino file.
